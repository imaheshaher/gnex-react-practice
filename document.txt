### Start Project
 npx create-react-app app-name

After installing project biolerplate

### To run the react app
### `npm Start`

### To  install dependencies
npm install  dependencies_name

### React Folder Structure
|-node_modules
|-public
|    favicon.ico
|    index.html
|    logo192.png
|    logo512.png
|    manifest.json
|    robots.txt
|-src
│   App.css
│   App.js
│   App.test.js
│   index.css
│   index.js
│   logo.svg
│   reportWebVitals.js
│   setupTests.js

|package-lock.json
|package.json

------------------------------------------------------------
in src/index.js -> include App component which is src/App.js

when we add new component then we should work in src Folder
make a new Folder with name component
and Add new files in component folder that you want to write component
ex 
|-src
    |-component
    |   Header.js

then you write component in Header file
and import it into src/App.js

In such a manner you can write multiple component and import it into one component such as src/App.js

### component in react

###  `Functional component`
See the section about (https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) for more information.

###   `Class component`

See the section about (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) for more information

### State and Lifecycle
(https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
    state is as like a variable which store the value 
 -   in Functional component we declare state as 
        const [count,setCount] = useState(intialValue)
        when we need to change state value then  use setCount(value) 
        when you access the state value then only use count

### props

    props is used to pass the value from parent component to child component


### how to access state or props value in jsx
    -we have to use {state }

### React Routing
    react create a single page application 
    if you want to redirect to another page or open another page
    then we use react-router-dom by installing npm install react-router-dom

    import {BrowserRouter as Router,Switch,Route} from 'react-router-dom' in src/App.js
    in App.js <Router>
                <Switch>
                <Route exact path="/pathname"><Component_name /> </Route>
                </Switch>
             </Router>
            the that component should render on localhost/pathname
